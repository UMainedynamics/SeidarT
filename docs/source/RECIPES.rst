Recipes
-------

An extension of the SeidarT package was built to handle examples. You can find the `SeidarT-Recipes <https://github.com/UMainedynamics/SeidarT-Recipes>`_ on the UMainedynamics GitHub page. The current list of recipes (with links to the docs and source code) include:

 - Common midpoint survey `docs <https://github.com/UMainedynamics/SeidarT-Recipes/tree/main/src/seidart-recipes/single_source>`_ and `source code <https://github.com/UMainedynamics/SeidarT-Recipes/blob/main/src/seidart-recipes/single_source/single_source.py>`_
 - Common offset survey `docs <https://github.com/UMainedynamics/SeidarT-Recipes/tree/main/src/seidart-recipes/common_offset>`_ and `source code <https://github.com/UMainedynamics/SeidarT-Recipes/blob/main/src/seidart-recipes/common_offset/common_offset_recipe.py>`_
