Recipes
-------

An extension of the `SeidarT <https://github.com/UMainedynamics/SeidarT>`_ package was built to handle examples. You can find the SeidarT-Recipes (`source code <https://github.com/UMainedynamics/SeidarT-Recipes>`_, `docs <https://umainedynamics.github.io/SeidarT-Recipes/docs/build/html/index.html>`_ on the UMainedynamics GitHub page. The current list of recipes with links to the docs and source code (Python script), model PNG, project file, receiver file, and README include:

Electromagnetic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 - Common midpoint survey (`docs <https://github.com/UMainedynamics/SeidarT-Recipes/tree/main/src/seidart-recipes/single_source>`_ and `source code <https://github.com/UMainedynamics/SeidarT-Recipes/blob/main/src/seidart-recipes/single_source/single_source.py>`_)
 
 - Common offset survey `docs <https://github.com/UMainedynamics/SeidarT-Recipes/tree/main/src/seidart-recipes/common_offset>`_ and `source code <https://github.com/UMainedynamics/SeidarT-Recipes/blob/main/src/seidart-recipes/common_offset/common_offset_recipe.py>`_
 
 - Loading data into an Array object (`docs <https://umainedynamics.github.io/SeidarT-Recipes/docs/build/html/load-array-from-file-readme.html>`_ and `source code <https://github.com/UMainedynamics/SeidarT-Recipes/tree/main/src/seidart-recipes/load_array_from_file>`_)
 
 .. - Composite radargram (`docs <>`_ and `source code <>`_) that compiles multiple models to simulate a broadband source such as multimodal pulse radar. 
 
 - Synthetic Fabric Generation (`docs <https://umainedynamics.github.io/SeidarT-Recipes/docs/build/html/synthetic-fabric-readme.html>`_ and `source code <https://github.com/UMainedynamics/SeidarT-Recipes/tree/main/src/seidart-recipes/fabric>`_) to simulate and generate single to multi-pole c-axes distributions.
 
 - Absorbing boundary performance analysis (`docs <https://umainedynamics.github.io/SeidarT-Recipes/docs/build/html/boundary-performance-readme.html>`_ and `source <https://github.com/UMainedynamics/SeidarT-Recipes/tree/main/src/seidart-recipes/boundary_performance>`_) for 2D electromagnetic wave propagation. 
.. - Isotropic/Anisotropic travel times (`docs <>`_ and `source <>`_)
