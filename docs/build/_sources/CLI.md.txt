## Command Line Interface 

The primary *SeidarT* functionality can be accessed via *Bash* command line namely: *prjbuild*, *prjrun*, *sourcefunction*, *arraybuild*, *rcxdisplay*, *im2anim*, and *orientsynth*. This is useful for scripting *Bash* files. If building outside of the conda environment, ensure that the required dependencies are installed.
